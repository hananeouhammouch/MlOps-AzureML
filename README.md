# Operationalizing Machine Learning in Azure

## Summary of the project
**This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.**

The main object of this project is to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit product by using a dataset  (located here: https://www.kaggle.com/henriqueyamahata/bank-marketing ) related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution by creating a model and deploying it into production using Azure ML

Where we apply Ml-Ops principle by starting  with the authenticating to Azure Machine Learning services, then the creation of an Automated ML experiment and the deployment of the best model , after that we enable the loging so that we can review important log information , then we consum the model endpoint and we finelly create and publish the pipeline to automate all this previous step
