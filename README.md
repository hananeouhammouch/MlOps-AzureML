# Operationalizing Machine Learning

## Overview
**This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.**

Where we apply Ml-Ops principle by starting  with the authenticating to Azure Machine Learning services , then the creation of an Automated ML experiment and the deployment of the best model , after that we enable the loging so that we can review important log information , then we consum the model endpoint and we finelly create and publish the pipeline to automate all this previous step

## Summary of the project <a name="Summary"></a>
The purpose of this project is to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit product by using a dataset  (located here: https://www.kaggle.com/henriqueyamahata/bank-marketing ) related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution by creating two different process:


Authentication
Automated ML Experiment
Deploy the best model
Enable logging
Swagger Documentation
Consume model endpoints

In this project, yocontinue to work with the Bank Marketing dataset. You will use Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. You will also create, publish, and consume a pipeline
## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
